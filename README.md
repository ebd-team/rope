# Rope

Rope is an experimental project showcasing various approaches to **remote control for drones**.  
It demonstrates how to combine **low-latency communication**, **gamepad input handling**, and **real-time video/telemetry streaming** into a flexible control system.

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 Gamepad input capture and transmission  
- 📡 Low-latency communication channels (WebSocket, TCP/UDP, WebRTC)  
- 🎥 Video and telemetry streaming integration  
- 🔧 Modular design for experimenting with different transport layers  
- 🚀 Focus on drone and robotics applications  

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide a **sandbox** for testing different control methods  
- Explore **efficient protocols** for remote vehicle operation  
- Create a reference for **drone developers and hobbyists**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript (frontend)  
- .NET backend for communication and telemetry  
- FFmpeg / MediaMTX for video streaming
